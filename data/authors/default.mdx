## About Tony Geiser

I’m Tony Geiser—former Marine, current IT consultant, father of two active-duty sons, and unapologetic military sci-fi junkie. I run **Sol Defense Corps** because I believe science fiction should come with plasma burns, moral dilemmas, and the occasional orbital drop.

My gateway drug? _Starship Troopers_, sometime in the late ’80s. That book hit me like a boot to the head and left me seeing powered armor and existential dread in every foxhole. Since then, I’ve devoured anything with warzones, alien hordes, and a little tactical nuance. (_Aliens_ is still the perfect movie. I won’t be taking questions.)

Along the way, I’ve worked as a bartender, a wrench-turning airplane mechanic, and now I herd computers for a living.

Through it all, sci-fi has been my compass and my escape pod. It’s more than entertainment, it’s how I make sense of war, tech, leadership, and what it means to be human when the bugs get through the wire.

**Sol Defense Corps** is my fighting hole on the web, built for readers who want the real stuff. No fluff. No fake geek chic. Just hard-hitting reviews, lore deep-dives, tactical rants, and the occasional emotional damage from a well-written character death.

Our motto is simple: **Solis Supra Omnia**—the Sun Above All.
