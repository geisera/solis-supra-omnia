summary: DARPA’s POWER (Persistent Optical Wireless Energy Relay) program has shattered expectations — beaming over 800 watts of laser energy across 5.3 miles at White Sands Missile Range. That’s enough juice to run a toaster or small AC unit — and, yes, even pop popcorn on demand.

### DARPA Powers Popcorn Via Laser — 5.3 Miles Away

DARPA’s POWER (Persistent Optical Wireless Energy Relay) program has shattered expectations — beaming over **800 watts** of laser energy across **5.3 miles** at White Sands Missile Range. That’s enough juice to run a toaster or small AC unit — and, yes, even pop popcorn on demand.

This wasn’t a trick effect. A custom receiver — compact aperture, parabolic mirror, and photovoltaic array — captured the laser pulse (over a 30‑second burst) and converted about **20 %** of it back to electricity. DARPA’s POWER lead Paul Jaffe called it “obliterating previously reported optical power‑beaming demonstrations”.

Why popcorn? A cheeky nod to the 1985 cult‑classic _Real Genius_, where a laser fills a room with popped corn — only here, it’s DARPA’s real‑world version.

### Why This Matters

- **Fuel‑free field ops**: No more long, vulnerable fuel supply lines. Beam power where troops, drones, or sensors need it — instantly and cordlessly.
- **Next‑gen power web**: Moving into Phase 2, DARPA aims to deploy relay drones and vertical beam links — ideally powering UAVs and remote outposts.
- **Atmospheric challenge**: Beaming through 1200 m of thick desert air wasn’t easy. Efficiency may drop in humid or urban skies . Still, this was a deliberate stress test.

### Sci‑Fi Meets Reality

This breakthrough could fuel endless mission possibilities — think laser‑powered drones, forward‑deployed bases, or mesh networks of aerial power relays. It’s Tesla’s dream — but now with military-grade precision.

And yes — popcorn. Because every great sci‑fi tech demo needs a kernel of humor.

### What’s Next

- **Join‑the‑dots relays**: Drone or satellite chained beam networks to push power farther and around obstacles.
- **Efficiency boost**: Targeted solar arrays and tuning to specific laser wavelengths could double or triple conversion rates.
- **Platform integration**: Expect power beams directed at UAVs, remote sensors, or even expeditionary command centers — forward power on tap.

An iconic sci‑fi trope has just leapt into reality. DARPA’s laser popcorn pop is a pivotal shift in military logistics and futuristic energy warfare.
