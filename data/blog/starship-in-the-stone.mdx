### Introduction

Nothing says “destiny awaits” like finding a legendary spaceship hidden inside a rock.

In _The Starship in the Stone_, M.R. Forbes kicks off the _Starship Magic_ series with an accidental hero, an ancient starship, and a universe that blends Arthurian myth with pulse-pounding sci-fi action.

It's Arthurian legend by way of _Battlestar Galactica_, with enough firefights, rogue AIs, and cosmic mysteries to make even Merlin dizzy. The plot? Easy: pull the sword from the stone, except the sword is a starship, and now the entire galaxy wants it.

And yes, it ends on a cliffhanger. Buckle up.

### The Gist

Thomas is a nobody, a guilt-ridden veteran hiding from his past, until he stumbles upon Excalibur, an ancient starship literally embedded in stone.

Suddenly he's thrust into command, running for his life as ruthless factions close in, all eager to control the legendary vessel.

With an AI that thinks it's Merlin and a ragtag crew straight out of legend, Thomas must stay alive long enough to figure out why he was chosen, and what it really means to rule.

There's interstellar combat, space chases, magical tech, and just enough backstabbing to keep you wary of everyone.

Now Thomas has to dodge bounty hunters, alien warlords, and his own crippling self-doubt to become the leader no one, especially him, expected.

### The Big Ideas

- **Destiny is a starship you didn't ask for.**
- **Legends aren't dead, they're hiding in orbit.**
- **When your allies are mythic heroes, trust issues get complicated fast.**

Truth warps. Loyalties crumble. And somewhere deep in the hull, a prophecy wakes up.

### Rule of Cool

- Excalibur isn't just a spaceship; it's a futuristic relic dripping with ancient lore.
- Magic meets tech: enchanted weaponry, star-drives powered by prophecy, and armor suits that would make King Arthur jealous.
- Space battles executed with military precision but spiced with mythic drama.
- AI Merlin dropping cryptic hints like cosmic breadcrumbs, frustrating, but awesome.
- Characters that blend knightly honor with gritty survival instincts, like Camelot meets the Marines.

This isn't just “King Arthur in space.”

It's round-table warfare with plasma cannons.

### The POV Character

Thomas thought he'd left heroics behind but finds himself commanding the most famous spaceship in history.

He's capable but haunted, practical but burdened by past failures. Thomas doesn't want to lead; he just keeps ending up in charge because nobody else survives long enough.

His arc is about embracing the mantle of leadership, even if he must drag himself through doubt, dread, and devastating odds to do it.

Watching Thomas grow from reluctant survivor to legendary captain makes every twist more rewarding.

Also, his sarcasm under pressure is gold.

### What Forbes Gets Right

- **Mythic sci-fi that feels fresh:** knights and spaceships collide spectacularly.
- **Real tension:** Each fight, betrayal, and reveal ratchets up stakes that genuinely matter.
- **Characters with depth:** even minor players carry emotional weight, complexity, and relatable motives.
- **A storyline that moves like an orbital drop:** once it starts, gravity does the rest.

The pacing? Perfect. No wasted ammo here.

### What You Might Not Like

- **Huge cliffhanger:** You'll shout “Really?!” and instantly search for book two.
- **Arthurian tropes played straight:** chosen-one clichés, prophetic mumbo-jumbo, unapologetically embraced (it works).
- **A galaxy that never lets up:** If you prefer calm space adventures, pick another orbit.

Some might say, "We've seen Arthur before," to which I reply: Sure, but never like this.

### What This Book Means to Me

Heroism isn't always chosen; sometimes it's dropped in your lap with zero instructions and a dozen assassins at your back.

Thomas' struggle resonated deeply: navigating leadership, trust, and redemption when failure seems inevitable but surrender isn't an option.

It's raw, urgent, and emotional. Victory isn't about winning battles, it's about reclaiming your purpose amid chaos.

I didn't know I needed Arthurian military sci-fi until Forbes put Excalibur in orbit and handed me the controls.

### Who is _The Starship in the Stone_ for?

If your sci-fi tastes lean toward military thrillers, ancient mysteries, and characters who battle destiny as fiercely as they do enemy warships, this is your launchpad.

Imagine _Star Wars_ meets _Camelot_, with a dash of _Firefly_ irreverence and _Battlestar Galactica_ intensity. Forbes reminds us that leadership sucks, prophecies are headaches, and legendary starships don't come with manuals.

It's smart sci-fi adventure without the pretension.

### The Final Word

_The Starship in the Stone_ is relentless, engaging, and unapologetically epic.

It sucks you into its fusion of fantasy and hard sci-fi, delivers gripping starship battles and heartfelt leadership struggles, and doesn't stop until you're begging for the next mission.

Grab your armor, strap in, and prepare for launch, and bring snacks, because you'll be here a while.
