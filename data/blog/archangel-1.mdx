Rick Partlow’s *Archangel* kicks off the **Archangel** series with a rocket-assisted leap into
powered armor warfare, black-ops politics, and transhuman morality. Partlow blends the pace of a
modern shooter with themes pulled from Heinlein and Scalzi, military service, cybernetic identity,
and the price of obedience ([amazon][1]).

### The Gist

Raphael “Rafe” Alvarez was killed in action. Then the government brought him back, rebuilt in secret as a covert supersoldier with experimental Archangel armor. Cut off from his past and repurposed as a weapon, Rafe uncovers a conspiracy that runs deeper than any mission log. Now, hunted by the system that created him, he must fight not just to survive, but to decide who he still is.

### The Big Ideas

- **Post-human identity** – What happens when your body isn’t yours anymore?
- **The ethics of resurrection** – If the state owns your second chance at life, do you still own your soul?
- **Shadow wars & autonomy** – Operating off the books means asking whether the mission still matters.
- **Loyalty vs. justice** – Rafe’s true battle isn’t with enemies, it’s with orders he can no longer follow.

### Rule of Cool

- Powered armor that flies, cloaks, and tanks railgun rounds like a boss.
- Infiltration missions across urban warzones, orbital black sites, and scorched battlefields.
- A soldier turned rogue asset, Jason Bourne meets _Halo_.
- Slick tech: neural implants, combat AI, stealth drones, and next-gen military hardware.

### The POV Character

Rafe Alvarez: Marine, KIA, resurrected asset. Once a war hero, now a state secret with a conscience. His struggle isn’t just external, it’s existential. Rafe’s journey from tool to man is marked by grit, grief, and flashes of humanity that cut through the armor.

### What Partlow Gets Right

- **Action pacing** – Partlow writes with kinetic energy; fight scenes are brutal, cinematic, and relentless.
- **Tech-military grounding** – The gear feels real, with just enough handwavium to stay fun.
- **Emotional stakes** – Beneath the armor, Rafe’s trauma, loyalty, and confusion resonate.
- **Clean prose, dirty world** – Partlow’s writing is tight, propulsive, and never gets bogged down.

### What You Might Not Like

- **Lone-wolf trope** – Some readers may crave more ensemble dynamics; this is Rafe’s story, front and center.
- **Moral ambiguity** – No clean wars here, just tradeoffs and betrayals, which may frustrate readers who want a noble cause.
- **Near-future cynicism** – The setting isn’t quite dystopian, but hope is scarce and heroes bleed.

### What This Book Means to Me

- **The soul behind the soldering** – _Archangel_ makes you care not just about how the armor works, but what it’s for.
- **A different kind of heroism** – Not medals, not speeches, just a guy doing the right thing when nobody’s watching.
- **High-tech heartache** – Power doesn’t bring clarity. It brings choices, and Rafe’s hit hard.
- **The thrill of rebellion** – There’s something deeply satisfying about watching a weapon break its leash.

### Who is _Archangel_ for?

**This book is for** fans of Marko Kloos, Jason Anspach & Nick Cole, and anyone who likes their mil‑sci‑fi with fast drops, hard choices, and moral heat beneath the gunmetal.

### The Final Word

If you’re into powered armor, covert ops, and one man’s war against the machine that made him, _Archangel_ delivers the payload. Fast, tight, and smarter than it looks on the surface, this is mil‑sci‑fi with bite and brains.
